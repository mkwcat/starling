# Starling

Starling is an unofficial Wii channel for loading games with patches. The project is a work-in-progress, and is not ready for general use even by technical users.

## Planned Features

Without any requirement for installation or modification to the Wii system memory itself, Starling hopes to provide the following:

* Game file replacement.
* Save data redirection.
* Support for patch configuration and module formats (such as [Riivolution](https://github.com/AerialX/rawksd), [Brainslug](https://github.com/Chadderz121/brainslug-wii)).
* Game backup loading.
